# UAID-001 Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Universal AI Development Standard (UAID-001).

## Overview

UAID-001 defines a universal protocol and directory structure for AI development tools. The architecture is designed to be:

- **Tool-agnostic**: Works with any AI-assisted development tool
- **Extensible**: Easily adaptable to different project types and workflows
- **Standardized**: Consistent across implementations
- **Scalable**: From single-developer projects to enterprise teams

![Architecture Overview](./diagrams/architecture.md)

## Core Components

### 1. Directory Structure

The `.ai-dev` directory is the foundation of UAID, providing a standardized location for all AI-related project data:

```
.ai-dev/                # UAID root directory
├── spec.json           # Specification and compatibility info
├── rules/              # Rule definitions
│   ├── core/           # Core rules
│   ├── tools/          # Tool-specific rules
│   └── custom/         # Project-specific rules
├── analysis/           # Analysis outputs
│   ├── codebase/       # Code analysis results
│   ├── context/        # Context building results
│   └── metrics/        # Code metrics
├── memory/             # Memory storage
│   ├── long-term/      # Persistent memory
│   └── sessions/       # Session-based memory
├── adapters/           # Tool adapters
│   ├── cursor/         # Cursor adapter
│   ├── windsurf/       # Windsurf adapter
│   └── roo/            # Roo adapter
└── prompts/            # AI prompt templates
```

### 2. Rule System

The rule system defines how AI tools analyze and interact with code:

- **Core Rules**: Required rules that apply to all projects
- **Tool Rules**: Specific to particular AI development tools
- **Custom Rules**: Project-specific rules defined by developers

Rules use a standardized format (`.json`) that any UAID-compatible tool can interpret.

### 3. Analysis System

The analysis system stores results from code analysis, providing a shared understanding of the codebase:

- **Codebase Analysis**: Structure, dependencies, and patterns
- **Context Building**: Relationships and meaning in the code
- **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements of code quality and complexity

### 4. Memory System

The memory system stores information about interactions between developers and AI tools:

- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent knowledge about the project
- **Session Memory**: Temporary context within a development session

### 5. Tool Adapters

Adapters enable different AI development tools to work with the UAID standard:

- **Cursor Adapter**: For Cursor IDE
- **Windsurf Adapter**: For Windsurf
- **Roo Adapter**: For Roo
- **Custom Adapters**: For other tools

### 6. Implementation Layers

UAID can be implemented at different levels:

- **Phase 1**: Shell scripts and prompt templates
- **Phase 2**: Local server with APIs
- **Phase 3**: Mission Control Panel (MCP) server
- **Phase 4**: Full ecosystem integration

## Key Workflows

### Code Analysis Workflow

![Code Analysis Workflow](./diagrams/workflows.md#code-analysis)

1. Developer requests analysis of a file
2. UAID loads applicable rules
3. Analysis is performed based on rules
4. Results are stored in the analysis directory
5. AI is provided with analysis for enhanced understanding

### Context Building Workflow

![Context Building Workflow](./diagrams/workflows.md#context-building)

1. Developer requests context for a file or task
2. UAID retrieves code analysis, related files, and project structure
3. Memory is searched for relevant interactions
4. Comprehensive context is built
5. AI is provided with enhanced context for better assistance

### Memory Management Workflow

![Memory Management Workflow](./diagrams/workflows.md#memory-management)

1. Developer interacts with AI
2. Interaction is stored in the memory system
3. Context is linked to the interaction
4. Future interactions can retrieve relevant past memory
5. AI can build upon past insights

### Tool Integration Workflow

![Tool Integration Workflow](./diagrams/workflows.md#tool-integration)

1. AI tool loads UAID adapter
2. Adapter connects to UAID system
3. Tool accesses shared rules, analysis, and memory
4. Tool contributes back to the shared knowledge
5. Developer can switch tools while maintaining context

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between components
2. **Data Portability**: Information can move between tools
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with simple implementations, enhanced with advanced ones
4. **Tool Independence**: No dependency on specific AI tools
5. **Developer Control**: Developers always have final say over the system

## Future Architecture Enhancements

As UAID evolves through its phases, the architecture will be enhanced with:

1. **Synchronization Protocol**: For keeping local and remote UAID instances in sync
2. **Collaboration Model**: For team-based development
3. **Plugin System**: For extending UAID with custom functionality
4. **Security Framework**: For enterprise-grade protection
5. **Analytics Pipeline**: For insights into AI-assisted development
